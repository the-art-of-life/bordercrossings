= Border Crossings Test Application

To run the application using Maven (Java 11): 

`mvn spring-boot:run`

Or you just visit it deployed on Heroku:

https://bordercrossings.herokuapp.com

[NOTE]
====
Few notes to implementation:

- on correct input country codes it returns existing border crossings or HTTP 404 if no crossing exists as specified by the given task
- on invalid input country codes `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown (results in HTTP 500), custom exception and more user friendly error handling is not implemented 
- extension points (effectivity improvements) are described in comments in the source code as there are many options depending on the context which was not specified in the given task
